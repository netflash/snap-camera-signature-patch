# üîì Snap Camera Signature Patch
Unlocks all Snap Lenses with [Snap Camera Server](https://github.com/ptrumpis/snap-camera-server)

TL;DR  
[Web based online Patch Tool](https://ptrumpis.github.io/snap-camera-signature-patch/)

## ‚ÑπÔ∏è About
Snap `lens.lns` files come with a *Signature* preventing anyone from distributing or modifying lenses.

This patch will disable all *Signature* checks of your Snap Camera application to use modified Snap Lenses.

Enabling you to
- Access/Download all Snap Lenses from the web https://lens.snapchat.com/
- Use modified Lenses (Remove Watermarks / Change Backgrounds...)

## ‚ö† Requirements
- Snap Camera 1.19 - 1.21 (Windows)
- Snap Camera 1.21 (Mac OS)

Now with Windows and Mac OS support üëç

## üöÄ Usage
Use the web based online patch tool
- [Web based online Patch Tool](https://ptrumpis.github.io/snap-camera-signature-patch/)

### üçè Additional steps on Mac OS
Mac OS users will also have to run these commands inside the Terminal application after applying the patch.

1. Make the binary executable:
```sh
chmod +x "/Applications/Snap Camera.app/Contents/MacOS/Snap Camera"
```

2. Remove the Mac OS code signing:
```sh
sudo codesign --remove-signature "/Applications/Snap Camera.app"
```

3. Remove extended file attributes:
```sh
sudo xattr -cr "/Applications/Snap Camera.app"
```

#### Error: application can't be opened

You can try to fix the error by running the command:
```sh

```
