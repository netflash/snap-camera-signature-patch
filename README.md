## ℹ️ About
Snap `lens.lns` files come with a *Signature* preventing anyone from distributing or modifying lenses.

This patch will disable all *Signature* checks of your Snap Camera application to use modified Snap Lenses.

Enabling you to
- Access/Download all Snap Lenses from the web https://lens.snapchat.com/
- Use modified Lenses (Remove Watermarks / Change Backgrounds...)

## ⚠ Requirements
- Snap Camera 1.21.0 (Windows)

This works on Windows only (because I can't afford a Mac lol).

The next **Snap Camera Server v4** release will probably offer a Mac solution though.
